           <h2>Design Brief</h2>
           <div>
               <p>Design a home page for the OBF suitable for the site map below. This could be implemented by creating a custom Wordpress theme, although CMSes will be considered, so long as they have an easy-to-update-site interface. Static site generators such as Jekyll or Hugo are not suitable. <a href="https://github.com/OBF/homepage/blob/master/design.md">More details...</a></p>

           <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <div>
               <p>This design inspired by <a href="https://demo.themefuse.com/philanthropy/">Philanthropy</a> theme.</p>
               <p>I have researched and organized OBF website contents and decided to choose the Philanthropy theme as my inspiration to redesign the OBF website. This theme is suitable for OBF because there are many similarities that are expected to cover OBF needs. My design is just an ilustration that we can develop according to OBF needs . 
               </p>
               <p>I modified in some parts from the original theme to meet OBF needs such as putting board of directors in the home page. In terms of setting the contents I have made Get Involved page to make it easier for users to contribute. For a more detailed explanation please see the ilustration below:</p>
           </div>
        
           <h2>#Homepage</h2>
           <p>In homepage section, I give some design options and a breakdown.</p>
           <div>
               <div class="color">
                   <h5>1. Color Choices</h5>
                   <p>I have provided some color choices that matches the main color of the OBF. There are many choices and I choose these three to present because they have a good combination.</p>
                   <img src="img/coloroptions.png">
               </div>
                
               <div class="slide">
                   <h5>2. Slide Options</h5>
                   <p>I have made two slide options: 1. Slide with Images, 2. Slide with Colors. We can also combine both images or colors.</p>
                   <img src="img/slideoption1.png">
                   <img src="img/slideoption2.png">
               </div>
                
               <div class="breakdown">
                   <h5>3. A Breakdown</h5>
                   <p>This breakdown is my attempt to make a detailed explanation in all parts. The part that we can't see in the homepage will be explained here. There is also an example of drop down menu.</p>

           <h2>#Page Preview</h2>
           <div>
               <div class="about">
                   <h5>1. Preview of About Page</h5>
                   <p>This design is clean and simple.</p>
                   <img src="img/about.png">
               </div>
                
               <div class="getInvolved">
                   <h5>2. Preview of Get Involved Page</h5>
                   <p>I put all of things that need user contribution in Get Involved page. We still have to link each choice to the final page untill the last button.</p>
                   <img src="img/getinvolved.png">
               </div>
                
               <div class="donation">
                   <h5>3. Preview of Donation Page</h5>
                   <p>This donation page is still a rough design. I can develop this page if I get a detailed description about donation from OBF. What kind of donation that OBF want, What is method that OBF use to donate, etc.</p>
                   <img src="img/donation.png">

           </div>
           
           <h2>How to Implement </h2>
           <p>The important thing to start this work is organizing the contents. I should make sure that I manage contents properly and correctly under the supervision of a mentor. For example, How many pages that we want, What we want to put in the menu bar, what will be put in the About page, etc. So, if I am accepted as an intern I'll make a draft of the content before starting.</p>
           <h5>1. Use a WordPress CMS</h5>
           <p>We already know that WordPress is the best CMS that provide the most benefits. I choose WordPress than the other CMS because WordPress CMS is easy to update and has many plugins that we can add to extend functionality or add new features to OBF website. Please, see the general description of making OBF website with WordPress CMS below:
           </p>
           <p>All of you maybe already know how to use WordPress CMS but I should write it here to make it clear.</p>
           <p>Step 1:</p>
           <p>Domain name >> Hosting >> Install WordPress >> Login to WordPress</p>
           <p>Step 2:</p>
           <p>Install Theme >> Customize >> Install Elementor Plugin (we can use other plugin) >> Create Contents  of Website (Homepage, About, Blog, etc.) >> Install other plugin if needed (Donation Plugins: Give or Donorbox, Contact Plugins: WPForms or Contact Form 7, etc)</p>
           <p>I have made a list of plugins that will be used in my design. Here is the list: . </p>
           <p>From those steps above, the main process is to create web contents. I have prepared a list of plugins or templates that will be used in my design. And also an alternative to create a different web outside the main web (OBF web) if needed such as web for BOSC or GSoC. But still, we need to place them in main web because they are part of OBF.</p>
           <h5>2. Make Custom Template</h5>
           <p>This is just an alternative if we can't get template like what we want. I'll write code to create templates as what we want and install it via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and I recommend using <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>. In term of how I'll write code to create the template is use HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and JavaScript framework or front end framework if needed. </p>
           <p>NOTES:</p>
           <p>The content (pictures, color, icon, words, etc.) is just to illustrate or visualize the design of website. Please, let me know if there is something inapproriate in choosing the content.</p>
           <p>The concept of the design (arrangement of menu, arrangement of page contents, features, etc.) based on my limited understanding of OBF which is very likely to occur errors. Revisions and changes are needed.</p>
